# shARe-App

shARe aims to be the world’s first augmented reality photo-sharing app. Built on Apple’s newly released ARKit framework, shARe can hang photos of whatever’s in front of you in mid-air just like a frame in the real world. And while that’s already novel, shARe aims to turn novelty into a meaningful social experience.

shARe will allow you to see the photos other people have hung through their adventures anywhere in the world. Whether it’s looking off a rooftop on a sunny day and wishing to see the way it’s blanketed by snow in winter, or gazing up a main street and seeing how the architecture and the community has evolved over time, shARe will let users stamp their view of the world onto the world for everyone else to see.
